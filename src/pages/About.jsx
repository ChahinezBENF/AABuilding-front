          Founded in 2016, AA Building Inspection started with three engineers
          and one clear mission: to make civil inspections faster, more reliable,
          and more transparent. Over the past decade, weâ€™ve grown from a small
          team into a trusted nationwide provider, completing more than 5,000
          inspections, supporting 120+ construction projects, and building
          partnerships with 40+ government and private agencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, our team of over 50 experts combines deep engineering knowledge
          with the latest technology to deliver accurate, efficient, and
          compliant inspection services. With every project, we remain committed
          to helping clients build safely, confidently, and sustainably.
